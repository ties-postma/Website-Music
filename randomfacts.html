        <H2>The idea to have all of the members wear masks started with Shawn "Clown" Crahan trying to freak out his bandmates</H2>
        <p>In the process of moving Crahan found an original Halloween clown mask buried in his belongings. Crahan began wearing it to band practices to the dismay of his bandmates, and Colsefni eventually started wrapping his face in electric tape. Drummer Joey Jordison eventually brought up that if two members were going to wear masks, everyone had to design their own mask to create a uniform for their band.</p>

        <H2>Slipknot were demonized following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, causing them to pass on touring opportunities and struggle to get radio play</H2>
        <p>The release of their sophomore album, Iowa, came just a couple of weeks before the 9/11 terrorist attacks while they were scheduled to co-headline a North American tour with System of a Down. The tour was delayed by a week following the attacks. Songs such as "People = Shit" and "The Heretic Anthem," on top of their imagery, caused countless bans on the band. Schools weren't allowing students to wear their shirts, radio stations wouldn't play their music and they struggled to get their lives back on track.</p>
